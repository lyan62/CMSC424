### Order first by number_of_flights in decreasing order, then source_city in the increasing order, and then dest_city in the increasing order.
### Note: You must generate the source and destination cities along with the airport codes.

### 4. Find the name of the airline with the maximum number of customers registered as frequent fliers.

### hours, minutes. Order by flightid.
### Don't worry about timezones -- assume all times are reported using the same timezone.
queries[5] = """

### 6. Write a query to find all the empty flights (if any); recall that all the flights listed
### in the flights table are daily, and that flewon contains information for a period of 9
### days from August 1 to August 9, 2016. For each such flight, list the flightid and the date.
### Order by flight id in the increasing order, and then by date in the increasing order.

queries[7] = """

### 8. Write a query to generate a list of customers who flew twice on two consecutive days, but did
### not fly otherwise in the 10 day period. The output should be simply a list of customer ids and

### Order by the customer name.

### 9. Write a query to find the names of the customer(s) who visited the most cities in the 10 day

### 10. Write a query that outputs a list: (AirportID, Total-Number-of-Flights, Airport-rank), where 
### we rank the airports 
### by the total number of flights that depart that airport. So the airport with the maximum number
### of flights departing gets rank 1, and so on. If two airports tie, then they should 
### both get the same rank, and the next rank should be skipped.
### Order the output in the increasing order by rank.
